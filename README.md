### Requirements:
- Node v14.15+

  - `git init`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "init"`

### Google Sheets Integration
1. Create your own Google Sheets
   1. Login your Google account at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets
   2. Create empty sheets
   3. Copy the header row from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sRIijZtI0aFvs-lAl_XnOHuHpgJoZ9hypWhGWYZ_iaM/edit?usp=sharing.
   4. When you create a blank spreadsheet in Google Sheet, you can get its ID from the address bar of your browser. Itâ€™s the string of random characters after the /d and before the /edit. Remember this ID for later use.
2. Create credentials for accessing Googlesheets API
   1. Login your Google account at https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs
   2. Click **Enable the Google Sheets API** and enter project name and click **Next**, in my example it's *ROI Calculator*
   3. Select **Web Server** in the **Configure your OAuth client* dropdown**, then click **Create**
   4. Click the **API Console** hyperlink below to go to the console page, then make sure you select the project you just created ![](./readme%20files/select%20your%20project.png)
   5. Click **Credentials** on the left side menu, then click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** on the main panel, select **Service Account**
   6. Enter the account name and optionally enter the description for this account, then click **Done**
   7. In the service account page, select **KEYS** tab, click **Add Key**, select **Create new key**, select **Key type** as **JSON** and click **Create**, keep the auto-downloaded JSON file for later use.
   8. Remember the email address of the service account your just created for later use ![](./readme%20files/service%20account%20address.png)
   9. In order to edit the spreadsheet we created in step 1 with this service account, we need to grant access to the email address we get from step 2.8
      1. In the spreadsheet, click **Share**
      2. Paste the email address and select it, then click **Done** to share the spreadsheet with it
3. Set up configuration and credentials in the React project
   1. In the config files, change the value of *GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID* to the ID you found at step 1.4
   2. At the developer console page, Credentials tab of your project, click **OAuth client** in the **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** ![](./readme%20files/oauth%20credentials.png)
      1. Add Authorized JavaScript origins, `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:3100`, these 2 origins are for local deployment. If you plan to deploy the app with other origin, you need to add URI here. After adding all origins, click **Save**
      2. Find the JSON file downloaded in step 2.7, change file name to `googlesheets-credential.json` and move the downloaded JSON file to the root directory of the React project
   > As we use `server.js` to provide functionality of the Google sheets API, when we run `npm run dev` to serve the app with *webpack-dev-server*, we still need `server.js` running. Check *package.json* to see the PORT we use to run `server.js`. Also check `webpack.config.js` `module.exports = { ..., devServer: { ..., proxy: ... } }` to see the port for which *webpack-dev-server* runs proxy.
